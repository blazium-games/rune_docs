# Integer to Float Node

The Integer to Float node converts an integer value to a floating-point number.

![Integer to Float Node](/img/nodes/integer_to_float.jpg "Integer to Float Node")

## Description

The Integer to Float node converts an integer value to its floating-point representation (e.g., 42 becomes 42.0).

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Input** (integer): The integer to convert to a floating-point number

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Output** (number): The floating-point representation of the input integer

## Special Notes

- If the input cannot be parsed as an integer, the result defaults to "0.0"
- The conversion preserves the numeric value but changes the type (e.g., 5 becomes 5.0)
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node

## Example Usage

Convert integer values to floating-point numbers for operations requiring decimal precision. Connect an integer output to the Input, then use the Output in nodes that require number input, such as Math nodes that work with floating-point values.
