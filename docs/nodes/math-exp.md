# Exp Node

The Exp node calculates the exponential function (e raised to the power of a value).

![Exp Node](/img/nodes/exp.jpg "Exp Node")

## Description

The Exp node calculates e (Euler's number ≈ 2.718) raised to the power of the input value. This is the inverse operation of the natural logarithm.

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Value** (number): The exponent to raise e to

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (number): e raised to the power of the input value

## Special Notes

- If the input cannot be parsed as a number, the result defaults to "1.0" (since e^0 = 1)
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node

## Example Usage

Calculate exponential values for growth calculations, decay functions, or scientific computations. Connect a number output to the Value input, then use the Result output in other calculations or comparisons.
