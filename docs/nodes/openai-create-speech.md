## Description

The Create Speech node generates audio from text using OpenAI's text-to-speech models. It supports multiple voices and output formats.

## Execution Inputs

- **Execute** (execution): Triggers the speech generation request

## Variable Inputs

- **Model** (string): The TTS model to use. Must be "tts-1" or "tts-1-hd" (default: "tts-1")
- **Voice** (string): The voice to use. Must be one of: "alloy", "echo", "fable", "onyx", "nova", "shimmer" (default: "alloy")
- **Input** (string): The text to convert to speech
- **ResponseFormat** (string, optional): Audio format. Must be "mp3", "opus", "aac", or "flac" (default: "mp3")
- **Speed** (float, optional): Speed of the generated speech. Must be between 0.25 and 4.0 (default: 1.0)

## Execution Outputs

- **Success** (execution): Execution continues here if the request succeeded
- **Failed** (execution): Execution continues here if the request failed

## Variable Outputs

- **Response** (string): Full JSON response from the API
- **AudioData** (string): Base64-encoded audio data
- **AudioSize** (integer): Size of the audio data in bytes
- **ErrorMessage** (string): Error message if request failed

## Special Notes

- Requires a valid API key configured via Set API Key node
- Maximum input text length is 4096 characters
- Audio data is returned as base64-encoded string
- Use Save Speech To File node to save the audio to disk
- "tts-1-hd" provides higher quality but is slower
- Speed values below 1.0 slow down speech, above 1.0 speed it up

## Example Usage

Generate speech from text:
1. Set Model to "tts-1"
2. Set Voice to "nova"
3. Set Input to "Hello, this is a test of text-to-speech."
4. Set ResponseFormat to "mp3"
5. Connect Execute to generate
6. Use AudioData output with Save Speech To File node to save
