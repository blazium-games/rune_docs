- **N** (integer, optional): Number of edited images to generate (1-10, default: 1)
- **Size** (string, optional): Image size. Must be one of: "256x256", "512x512", "1024x1024" (default: same as input image)
- **ResponseFormat** (string, optional): Format of the response. Must be "url" or "b64_json" (default: "url")
- **User** (string, optional): User identifier for tracking

## Execution Outputs

- **Success** (execution): Execution continues here if the request succeeded
- **Failed** (execution): Execution continues here if the request failed

## Variable Outputs

- **Response** (string): Full JSON response from the API
- **ImageUrl** (string): URL of the edited image (if ResponseFormat is "url")
- **ImageB64** (string): Base64-encoded image data (if ResponseFormat is "b64_json")
- **ErrorMessage** (string): Error message if request failed

## Special Notes

- Requires a valid API key configured via Set API Key node
- Input image must be a PNG file
- Mask image (if provided) must be a PNG file with the same dimensions as the input image
- White areas in the mask are edited, black areas are preserved
- If no mask is provided, the entire image may be edited
- Image and mask files must be accessible from the system

## Example Usage

Edit an image with a mask:
1. Set ImagePath to "path/to/image.png"
2. Set MaskPath to "path/to/mask.png" (white areas will be edited)
3. Set Prompt to "Add a red hat to the person"
4. Connect Execute to generate the edit
5. Use ImageUrl output to get the edited image

Edit an image without a mask:
1. Set ImagePath to "path/to/image.png"
2. Leave MaskPath empty
3. Set Prompt to "Make the background blue"
4. Connect Execute to generate the edit
