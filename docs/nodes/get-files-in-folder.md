![Get Files in Folder Node](/img/nodes/get_files_in_folder.jpg "Get Files in Folder Node")

## Description

The Get Files In Folder node scans a directory and returns a list of all files found within it. The file paths are returned as a newline-separated string or can be processed individually.

## Execution Inputs

- **In** (execution): Triggers scanning the folder

## Variable Inputs

- **Folder** (string): The path to the folder to scan

## Execution Outputs

- **Out** (execution): Execution continues here after scanning completes

## Variable Outputs

- **Files** (string): Newline-separated list of file paths found in the directory
- **Success** (boolean): "true" if the operation succeeded, "false" otherwise

## Special Notes

- The Folder path must exist and be a valid directory
- Paths are relative to the flow's working directory if not absolute
- Only files in the specified directory are returned (not files in subdirectories)
- File paths are returned as newline-separated strings
- The node validates paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
- If the folder doesn't exist or isn't accessible, Success will be "false"

## Example Usage

Get all files in a directory:
1. Set Folder to "src" or an absolute path
2. Connect In to scan the folder
3. Check Success output to verify
4. Use Files output to get the list of files
5. Split by newline to process individual file paths
