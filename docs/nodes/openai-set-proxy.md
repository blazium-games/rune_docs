## Description

The Set OpenAI Proxy node configures HTTP proxy settings for OpenAI API requests. It supports both basic proxy configuration and proxy authentication.

The proxy configuration is stored in session state and used by all subsequent OpenAI API calls in the flow.

## Execution Inputs

- **Execute** (execution): Triggers the proxy configuration

## Variable Inputs

- **ProxyConfig** (string): The proxy URL in the format `http://host:port` or `https://host:port`
- **ProxyAuth** (string, optional): Proxy authentication in the format `username:password` (optional)

## Execution Outputs

- **Success** (execution): Execution continues here if the proxy was successfully configured
- **Failed** (execution): Execution continues here if configuration failed

## Variable Outputs

- **Success** (boolean): "true" if the proxy was successfully configured, "false" otherwise
- **ErrorMessage** (string): Error message if configuration failed, empty string otherwise

## Special Notes

- The proxy configuration is stored in session state
- Proxy URL must be in valid format (`http://` or `https://`)
- Proxy authentication is optional but must be in `username:password` format if provided
- Proxy settings apply to all OpenAI API calls after this node executes
- To disable proxy, leave ProxyConfig empty or don't use this node

## Example Usage

Configure a proxy without authentication:
1. Set ProxyConfig to `http://proxy.example.com:8080`
2. Leave ProxyAuth empty
3. Connect Execute to start the flow

Configure a proxy with authentication:
1. Set ProxyConfig to `http://proxy.example.com:8080`
2. Set ProxyAuth to `username:password`
3. Connect Execute to start the flow
