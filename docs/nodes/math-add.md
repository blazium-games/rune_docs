# Add Node

The Add node performs addition of two numbers.

![Add Node](/img/nodes/add.jpg "Add Node")

## Description

The Add node calculates the sum of two numeric values. It accepts any numeric input (integer or float) and returns the result as a number.

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **A** (number): The first number to add
- **B** (number): The second number to add

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (number): The sum of A and B

## Special Notes

- If either input cannot be parsed as a number, the result defaults to "0.0"
- The node works with both integer and floating-point numbers
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node

## Example Usage

Add two numbers together, such as calculating totals or combining counts. Connect number outputs from Integer or Float nodes to the A and B inputs, then use the Result output in other calculations or comparisons.
