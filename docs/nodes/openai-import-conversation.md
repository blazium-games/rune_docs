## Description

The Import Conversation node restores a conversation from a JSON string exported by Export Conversation node. This allows you to restore conversation history, system messages, and continue conversations across sessions.

## Execution Inputs

- **Execute** (execution): Triggers importing the conversation

## Variable Inputs

- **ConversationJson** (string): JSON string containing the conversation data (from Export Conversation node)

## Execution Outputs

- **Success** (execution): Execution continues here if conversation was successfully imported
- **Failed** (execution): Execution continues here if import failed

## Variable Outputs

- **ConversationId** (string): The conversation ID of the imported conversation (may be new or restored)
- **Success** (boolean): "true" if conversation was successfully imported, "false" otherwise
- **ErrorMessage** (string): Error message if import failed

## Special Notes

- The ConversationJson must be valid JSON in the format exported by Export Conversation node
- The imported conversation gets a new conversation ID (or restores the original if available)
- All messages and system message are restored
- Imported conversations can be used immediately with chat completion nodes

## Example Usage

Import a saved conversation:
1. Load the conversation JSON from a file using Load Text File node
2. Connect the JSON content to ConversationJson input
3. Connect Execute to import
4. Use ConversationId output with chat completion nodes to continue the conversation
