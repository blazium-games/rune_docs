# Round (Float) Node

The Round (Float) node rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer, keeping it as a float.

![Round (Float) Node](/img/nodes/round_float.jpg "Round (Float) Node")

## Description

The Round (Float) node rounds a floating-point value to the nearest integer but returns the result as a floating-point number (e.g., 3.7 becomes 4.0).

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Value** (number): The floating-point number to round

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (number): The nearest integer to the input value, as a floating-point number

## Special Notes

- If the input cannot be parsed as a number, the result defaults to "0.0"
- Uses standard rounding (0.5 rounds up)
- Returns a floating-point number (e.g., 4.0 instead of 4)
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node

## Example Usage

Round floating-point numbers while maintaining float precision for downstream calculations. Connect a number output to the Value input, then use the Result output in other calculations or comparisons that require floating-point values.
