# Number Compare Node

The Number Compare node compares two numeric values using various comparison operators.

![Number Compare Node](/img/nodes/number_compare.jpg "Number Compare Node")

## Description

The Number Compare node performs numeric comparisons using operators such as equals, greater than, less than, etc. The result is a boolean value that can be used with Branch nodes for conditional logic.

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Value** (number): The first number to compare
- **CompareTo** (number): The second number to compare against
- **ComparisonMode** (string, property): The comparison operator:
  - "is_equal_to" / "is_not_equal_to"
  - "is_greater_than" / "is_greater_than_or_equal_to"
  - "is_less_than" / "is_less_than_or_equal_to"

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (boolean): `true` if the comparison succeeds, `false` otherwise

## Special Notes

- Comparison modes are set in the node properties
- Both inputs must be valid numbers
- Floating-point comparisons may have precision issues
- Use this node for numeric conditions like checking if a count exceeds a threshold

## Example Usage

Check if a count is greater than 100, or if a price equals a specific value. Connect the Result to a Branch node's Condition input for conditional execution.
