# Float Node

The Float node provides a floating-point (decimal) number value that can be used as input to other nodes.

![Float Node](/img/nodes/float.jpg "Float Node")

## Description

The Float node is a data node that outputs a floating-point number value. You can either set a static float value in the node properties or connect another node's output to provide the float dynamically.

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Input** (float, optional): If connected, uses the value from the connected node. If not connected, uses the value from node properties.

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Output** (float): The floating-point number value to use

## Special Notes

- If the Input pin is not connected, the node uses the "value" property
- If the Input pin is connected, it uses the value from the connected node
- Invalid values may cause errors or default behavior
- This node doesn't have execution pins - it's a pure data node
- Use this for decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, 0.5, 99.9)

## Example Usage

Provide decimal values for calculations or comparisons. Connect the Output to nodes that need float input, such as NumberCompare nodes or mathematical operations.
