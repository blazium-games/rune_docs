![Git Init Node](/img/nodes/git_init.jpg "Git Init Node")

## Description

The Git Init node creates a new Git repository at the specified path. If the directory doesn't exist, it will be created. The repository is initialized with a default configuration.

## Execution Inputs

- **In** (execution): Triggers the repository initialization

## Variable Inputs

- **Path** (string): The path where the Git repository should be initialized

## Execution Outputs

- **Out** (execution): Execution continues here after initialization completes

## Variable Outputs

- **Success** (boolean): "true" if the repository was successfully initialized, "false" otherwise
- **RepositoryPath** (string): The path to the initialized repository

## Special Notes

- The Path directory will be created if it doesn't exist
- If a repository already exists at the path, the operation will fail
- The repository is initialized with standard Git configuration
- Paths are relative to the flow's working directory if not absolute

## Example Usage

Initialize a new Git repository:
1. Set Path to "my-project" or an absolute path
2. Connect In to start the initialization
3. Check Success output to verify the repository was created
4. Use RepositoryPath output for subsequent Git operations
