![DateTime Compare Unix Node](/img/nodes/datetime_compare_unix.jpg "DateTime Compare Unix Node")

## Description

The DateTime Compare Unix node compares Unix timestamps (seconds since January 1, 1970) using various comparison operators.

## Execution Inputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Inputs

- **Value** (number): The first Unix timestamp to compare
- **CompareTo** (number): The second Unix timestamp to compare against
- **ComparisonMode** (string, property): The comparison operator (same as Number Compare)

## Execution Outputs

None (data node, no execution flow)

## Variable Outputs

- **Result** (boolean): `true` if the comparison succeeds, `false` otherwise

## Special Notes

- Inputs must be valid Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch)
- Comparison modes are set in the node properties
- Useful for date-based conditional logic

## Example Usage

Check if a timestamp is after a certain date, or compare two timestamps to see which is newer. Connect the Result to a Branch node for conditional execution.
