![Do N Node](/img/nodes/do_n.jpg "Do N Node")

## Description

The Do N node is a loop control node that executes a block of code a specified number of times. It's useful for repeating operations or processing items when you know the exact count.

## Execution Inputs

- **In** (execution): The execution flow enters through this pin to start the loop
- **Continue** (execution): The execution flow returns here after each iteration to continue the loop

## Variable Inputs

- **Count** (integer): The number of times to execute the loop

## Execution Outputs

- **Do** (execution): Execution path for the loop body - executed N times
- **Continue** (execution): Execution returns here after the loop body to continue to the next iteration

## Variable Outputs

- **Index** (integer): The current iteration index (0-based or 1-based)

## Special Notes

- The Count input determines how many times the loop executes
- If Count is 0 or negative, the loop body is not executed
- The Index output provides the current iteration number
- Connect the loop body to "Do" and connect the end of the loop body back to "Continue"

## Example Usage

Repeat an operation a specific number of times, such as retrying a failed operation 3 times, or processing a known number of items.
