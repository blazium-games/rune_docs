# Branch Node

The Branch node controls execution flow based on a boolean condition. It routes execution to either the "True" or "False" output based on the condition value.

## Description

The Branch node is a fundamental flow control node that allows you to create conditional logic in your flows. When execution reaches the Branch node, it evaluates a boolean condition and follows the appropriate execution path.

## Execution Inputs

- **In** (execution): The execution flow enters through this pin

## Variable Inputs

- **Condition** (boolean): The boolean value that determines which path to follow. Accepts "true", "false", "1", "0", "True", "False", or any string that evaluates to a boolean.

## Execution Outputs

- **True** (execution): Execution continues here if the condition is `true`
- **False** (execution): Execution continues here if the condition is `false`

## Variable Outputs

None

## Special Notes

- The condition is evaluated as a boolean. Values like "true", "1", "True" are considered `true`, while "false", "0", "False", or empty strings are considered `false`
- At least one execution output must be connected for the flow to continue
- The node always evaluates the condition and routes execution accordingly - there is no "else if" functionality (use multiple Branch nodes for complex conditions)

## Example Usage

Connect a Branch node after a comparison node to route execution based on the comparison result. For example, after a StringCompare node checking if a value equals "admin", connect the Branch's Condition input to the StringCompare's Result output, then route True to admin-specific nodes and False to regular user nodes.
