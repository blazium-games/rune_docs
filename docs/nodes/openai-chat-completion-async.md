# Create Chat Completion (Async) Node

The Create Chat Completion (Async) node initiates an asynchronous chat completion request. The response is handled in the background and can be retrieved later.

## Description

The Create Chat Completion (Async) node starts an asynchronous chat completion request. Unlike the synchronous version, this node returns immediately with a future response ID that can be used to retrieve the result later.

This is useful for long-running requests that might take significant time to complete.

## Execution Inputs

- **Execute** (execution): Triggers the async chat completion request

## Variable Inputs

- **Model** (string): The model to use (e.g., "gpt-3.5-turbo", "gpt-4")
- **Conversation** (string): The conversation ID from Create Conversation node
- **Temperature** (float, optional): Sampling temperature between 0 and 2
- **TopP** (float, optional): Nucleus sampling parameter
- **N** (integer, optional): Number of completions to generate
- **Stream** (boolean, optional): Whether to stream the response
- **Stop** (string, optional): Stop sequences (comma-separated)
- **MaxTokens** (integer, optional): Maximum tokens to generate
- **PresencePenalty** (float, optional): Penalty for token presence (-2.0 to 2.0)
- **FrequencyPenalty** (float, optional): Penalty for token frequency (-2.0 to 2.0)
- **LogitBias** (string, optional): JSON object mapping token IDs to bias values
- **User** (string, optional): User identifier for tracking

## Execution Outputs

- **Success** (execution): Execution continues here if the request was successfully initiated
- **Failed** (execution): Execution continues here if the request failed to start

## Variable Outputs

- **FutureResponseId** (string): ID to use for retrieving the response later
- **ErrorMessage** (string): Error message if request failed

## Special Notes

- The request is processed asynchronously in the background
- Use the FutureResponseId to retrieve the result when ready
- The response must be retrieved using appropriate async result retrieval mechanisms
- This node returns immediately without waiting for the API response

## Example Usage

Start an async chat completion:
1. Use Create Conversation node to get a conversation ID
2. Use Add User Message node to add your message
3. Connect Conversation output to this node's Conversation input
4. Set Model to "gpt-4" (slower model)
5. Connect Execute to start the async request
6. Store FutureResponseId for later retrieval
