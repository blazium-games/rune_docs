## Description

The Upload File node uploads a local file to OpenAI's servers. Uploaded files can be used for fine-tuning models, batch processing, or other file-based API operations.

## Execution Inputs

- **Execute** (execution): Triggers the file upload

## Variable Inputs

- **FilePath** (string): Path to the local file to upload
- **Purpose** (string): Purpose of the file. Must be one of: "fine-tune", "assistants", "batch", "vision" (default: "fine-tune")

## Execution Outputs

- **Success** (execution): Execution continues here if the upload succeeded
- **Failed** (execution): Execution continues here if the upload failed

## Variable Outputs

- **Response** (string): Full JSON response from the API
- **FileId** (string): Unique identifier for the uploaded file
- **FileName** (string): Name of the uploaded file
- **FileSize** (integer): Size of the uploaded file in bytes
- **ErrorMessage** (string): Error message if upload failed

## Special Notes

- Requires a valid API key configured via Set API Key node
- File must exist and be readable
- Maximum file size depends on the purpose (typically 512MB for fine-tuning)
- FileId can be used with other OpenAI API operations
- Purpose determines how the file can be used
- Files may take time to process after upload

## Example Usage

Upload a file for fine-tuning:
1. Set FilePath to "data/training_data.jsonl"
2. Set Purpose to "fine-tune"
3. Connect Execute to upload
4. Use FileId output for fine-tuning operations
