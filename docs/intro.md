# Introduction to RUNE

Welcome to the RUNE Interface documentation! R.U.N.E. – Routing & Utility Node Editor is a visual workflow editor that lets you build automation flows, data processing pipelines, and complex logic without writing traditional code.

## What is RUNE?

R.U.N.E. – Routing & Utility Node Editor is a node-based visual programming system. Instead of writing code line by line, you:

1. **Drag nodes** onto a canvas
2. **Connect them together** with wires
3. **Configure inputs** and outputs
4. **Run your flow** immediately

Think of it like building with LEGO blocks - each node does a specific job, and you connect them to create complex workflows.

## RUNE Interface vs RUNE CLI

RUNE comes in two forms:

- **RUNE Interface**: A graphical application with a visual editor. Perfect for designing flows, debugging, and interactive development.
- **RUNE CLI**: A command-line tool for executing flows. Perfect for automation, scripts, and CI/CD pipelines.

Both tools use the same flow format, so you can design in the Interface and execute with the CLI.

## Key Concepts

### Flows

A **flow** is a collection of connected nodes that work together to accomplish a task. Each flow is saved as a JSON file and can be shared, versioned, and executed.

### Nodes

**Nodes** are the building blocks of flows. Each node:
- Has **inputs** (data and execution pins)
- Performs a specific operation
- Produces **outputs** (data and execution pins)

### Execution Flow

Nodes are connected with **execution pins** that control the order of operations. When a node finishes, it triggers the next connected node.

### Data Flow

Nodes pass data between each other using **data pins**. Values flow from output pins to input pins.

### Session State

**Session State** is a storage system that persists data throughout a flow execution. You can set, get, and delete values that other nodes can access.

## Getting Started

Ready to start building? Choose your path:

- **[RUNE Interface Getting Started](/docs/rune-interface/getting-started)** - Learn to use the visual editor
- **[RUNE CLI Getting Started](/docs/rune-cli/getting-started)** - Learn to use the command-line tool
- **[Luau API Reference](/docs/luau/session-state)** - Explore the scripting API
- **[Node Reference](/docs/nodes/branch)** - Browse available nodes

## AI Integration

RUNE Interface includes built-in OpenAI integration that brings AI capabilities directly into your workflows:

- **[OpenAI Chat](/docs/rune-interface/openai-chat)** - Have conversations with AI models directly within RUNE Interface
- **[OpenAI Settings](/docs/rune-interface/openai-settings)** - Configure API keys, models, and workflow functions
- **[OpenAI Workflows](/docs/rune-interface/openai-workflows)** - Register your workflows as AI-callable functions
- **[OpenAI Nodes](/docs/nodes/openai-set-api-key)** - Use OpenAI nodes in your flows for chat, images, audio, and more

The AI can automatically call your registered workflows during conversations, creating powerful integrations between AI assistance and your automation flows.

## Extending RUNE

RUNE can be extended in multiple ways, depending on how deep you need to integrate:

- **[Custom Nodes](/docs/rune-interface/custom-nodes)** - Define new nodes with YAML + Luau scripts.
- **[MCP Server Integration](/docs/rune-interface/mcp-server)** - Expose external tools and services over the MCP protocol.
- **[Native Plugins with the RUNE Plugin SDK](/docs/rune-interface/plugins)** - Build compiled C/C++ plugins using the public SDK.
